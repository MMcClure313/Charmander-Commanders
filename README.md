# Group 6's Hangman
This application is a bite-size hangman application with all the functionality a player would need to play hangman.

On starting the application, a main menu appears with Start Statistics and Quit. 
Start will provide the user with an options menu to select the difficulty and theme they would like.
Statistics will bring the user to a minimal page displaying wins and losses, future versions will have a more detailed page.
Quit will close the application.

Within the hangman game, you will be introduced to the main game screen.
The left side is where the hangman is drawn upon guessing incorrectly.
The top right is the word to be guessed. It begins as all underlines, but as correct letters are guessed, the appropriate letters are then updated.
The middle right is your guessing field. You put in a single character to be guessed and click guess.
The bottom right is the letters that have already been guessed.

On the upper left is an exit button for the game. This will exit you to the main menu, after ensuring you want to leave.

When the game of hangman is complete, the player is prompted that they have won or lost. Dismissing or pressing any option on a notification will return the user to the main menu.

## To start the application:
Download the github repo into a java workspace. Our group worked with eclipse, and can not guarantee that the application will run off of other java IDEs. Run the application off of the App.java file.
