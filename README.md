# Group 6's Hangman
This application is a bite size hangman application with most of the functionality a player would need to play hangman.

On starting the application, a main menu appears with Start Options and Quit. 
Start will Start a game of hangman with a randomly generated word.
Options will bring you to the options screen, however all options aren't yet implimented.
Quit will close the applciation.

Within the hangman game, you will be introduced to the main game screen.
The left side is supposed to be where the hangman is drawn. This feature has not yet been implimented
The top right is the word to be guessed. It begins as all underlines, but as correct letters are guessed, the appropriate letters are then updated.
The middle right is your guessing field. You put in a single character to be guessed, and click guess.
The bottom right is the letters that have already been guessed.

This is where I write what happens when you run out of guesses or guess the word but I'm currently waiting on that to be finished.
