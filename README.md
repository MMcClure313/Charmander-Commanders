# Group 6's Hangman
This application is a bite-size hangman application with most of the functionality a player would need to play hangman.

On starting the application, a main menu appears with Start Options and Quit. 
Start will Start a game of hangman with a randomly generated word.
Options will bring you to the options screen, however, all options aren't yet implemented.
Quit will close the application.

Within the hangman game, you will be introduced to the main game screen.
The left side is supposed to be where the hangman is drawn. This feature has not yet been implimented
The top right is the word to be guessed. It begins as all underlines, but as correct letters are guessed, the appropriate letters are then updated.
The middle right is your guessing field. You put in a single character to be guessed and click guess.
The bottom right is the letters that have already been guessed.

On the upper left is an exit button for the game. This will exit you to the main menu, after ensuring you want to leave.

When the game of hangman is complete, the player is prompted that they have won or lost. Dismissing or pressing any option on a notification will return the user to the main menu.

## To start the application:
Download the github repo into a java workspace. Our group worked with eclipse, and can not guarantee that the application will run off of other java IDEs. Run the application off of the App.java file.
